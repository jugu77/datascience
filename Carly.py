#Carly wants to be able to market her low prices. We want to find out what the average price of a cut is.

#First, letâ€™s sum up all the prices of haircuts. Create a variable total_price, and set it to 0.

total_price = 0

# Iterate through the prices list and add each price to the variable total_price.

for price in prices:
  total_price += price
  # create a variable called average_price to find the avg price
  average_price = total_price/len(prices)
#Print the value of average_price
print('Average Haircut Price: $' + str(average_price))

#Use a list comprehension to make a list called new_prices, which has each element in prices minus 5.
new_prices = [price - 5 for price in prices]

#Print new_prices
print(new_prices)
